# Bird Classification

Small-scale image classification using bird species dataset from Kaggle. Compiled a CNN model in order to classify different species of birds correctly. The developed algorithm was supposed to predict only 15 bird species out of 450 available bird species in each run in order to lower the runtime. The final model produced %80-%95 accuracy on test data and validation data depending on different species selections.
